## Project Pluto – End-to-End Implementation Report

### Executive summary
- We built a browser-visible (headed) Playwright-based price scraper that streams real-time crypto prices to a Next.js web app via Connect RPC (protobuf) on a Node backend.
- We implemented robust E2E tests (UI, API, advanced criteria) and stress tests validating concurrency, latency, and resilience.
- Key improvements: prioritized page-open queue, LRU idle eviction, env-configurable concurrency caps, push-based DOM MutationObserver, debounced persistence, reconnect watchdog, metrics, and a unified test runner that boots the full stack.

## Architecture overview
- **Frontend**: Next.js app (`web/`) renders a simple UI to add/remove tickers, shows loading state until first price, flashes on updates, and persists tickers to `localStorage`. It uses a Connect Web client to receive a server-stream of prices.
- **Backend**: Node HTTP server (`server/`) exposes a Connect RPC service for `PriceService` (addTicker/removeTicker/streamPrices), CORS preflight, `/healthz`, and `/metrics`. A single headed Chromium is managed by `PlaywrightPool`, providing one `Page` per unique symbol and sharing updates to all subscribers.
- **Transport/Protocol**: Connect RPC over HTTP/1.1 (JSON/binary), browser-friendly, gRPC-Web compatible.
- **Testing**: Dedicated `playwright-tests/` workspace auto-starts the full stack via `webServer` and runs comprehensive suites (UI, API, advanced, stress, mega-stress). HTML reports and traces captured.

## Backend details
### Server (`server/src/index.ts`)
- HTTP server on port 8080, integrates `connectNodeAdapter` and registers `PriceService` routes.
- CORS: Handles `OPTIONS` preflight (204) with ACAO for `http://localhost:3000`; applies ACAO to other responses.
- Health: `/healthz` returns `{ ok: true, timestamp }`.
- Metrics: `/metrics` in Prometheus text format with `app_up`, `playwright_open_pages`, `playwright_subscribers_total`, `playwright_last_prices_total` based on `PlaywrightPool.getStats()`.

### PriceService implementation (`server/src/rpc/priceService.impl.ts`)
- Maintains `clientId -> Set<symbol>` and global `symbol` refcounts.
- `addTicker`:
  - Validates `^[A-Z]+USDT?$`.
  - Adds to the client's desired set; triggers reconcile.
  - Returns `initialPrice` if available; otherwise UI stays loading until stream emits.
  - Waits up to ~2s (20×100ms) for `PlaywrightPool.getLastPrice()` on first add.
- `removeTicker`:
  - Removes from the client's set; triggers reconcile.
- `streamPrices` (server streaming):
  - Opens a long-lived stream per client.
  - Reconciles desired symbols dynamically (subscribe/unsubscribe without tearing down the stream).
  - Converts Playwright callbacks to an async iterator via a tiny queue.
  - Immediately pushes last-known prices for all subscribed symbols, and again after 1s (best-effort) to reduce time-to-first-price.
  - Cleans up subscriptions and refcounts on disconnect.

### PlaywrightPool (`server/src/playwright/PlaywrightPool.ts`)
- Launches a single headed Chromium and one `Page` per unique uppercase symbol.
- Blocks heavy resources and ad/analytics requests via `context.route` to reduce overhead.
- Injects a `MutationObserver` at `document-start` to detect price DOM changes and calls an exposed `notifyPrice(price)`; also logs `PP_PRICE <value>` for redundancy.
- Maintains:
  - `symbolToPage`, `symbolToSubs`, `symbolToLast`, `symbolToIdleTimer`, `lastUsed`.
  - Priority open queue with buckets: hot (subscribed), warm (recently unsubscribed), cold (others).
  - In-flight open cap via `PLAYWRIGHT_OPEN_CONCURRENCY` (default 5).
  - Soft page cap via `PLAYWRIGHT_MAX_PAGES` (default 30) with LRU eviction of idle pages.
- Queue behavior:
  - De-dupes, priority upgrades, cancellation if no longer needed, and 10s timeout -> retry as high priority.
  - Logs enqueue/start/complete/failure for visibility.
- Screener fast-path:
  - Opens TradingView screener in a shared tab and extracts numeric price heuristically.
  - Caches results for 10s to improve time-to-first-price and reduce symbol-page pressure.
- Observability: `getStats()` aggregated by the server metrics endpoint.

## Frontend details
### Connect client (`web/src/lib/connect-client.ts`)
- Uses `createConnectTransport` with `baseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL || 'http://localhost:8080'`.
- Creates a typed `PriceService` client, and generates a stable `clientId` with `sessionStorage`.

### Main page (`web/app/page.tsx`)
- State: `symbols`, `prices`, `loading`, `justUpdated`, `status`.
- Sorting: symbols are uppercased and sorted alphabetically.
- Persistence: restores `symbols` from `localStorage` on mount; saves with 300ms debounce.
- Stream lifecycle:
  - Starts a server stream with `initialSymbols` (current list) and a reconnect watchdog.
  - Watchdog triggers a reconnect if no messages are seen for 15s (exponential backoff capped at 10s).
  - On each price update, sets `prices[symbol]`, clears `loading`, and briefly highlights the price cell.
- Add/remove:
  - `addTicker()` validates, de-duplicates, debounces (300ms), sets loading, calls `addTicker` RPC; if `initialPrice` is absent, keeps Loading… until stream delivers first price.
  - `removeTicker()` updates state then calls `removeTicker` RPC.
- UI affordances:
  - Displays `Status: idle|connecting|connected|retrying`.
  - Price cell shows `Loading…` while awaiting first price; never shows a dash during loading.
  - `data-testid` attributes on key nodes for robust tests.

## RPC/protocol choices
- We use Connect RPC (via `@connectrpc/connect` and `@connectrpc/connect-web`) rather than a native gRPC HTTP/2 server to:
  - Work seamlessly with browsers and standard proxies/CDNs using HTTP/1.1.
  - Keep endpoints curlable and JSON-capable in dev, with protobuf types for correctness.
  - Remain compatible with gRPC-Web semantics.

## Testing & tooling
### Unified test workspace (`playwright-tests/`)
- `playwright.config.ts`:
  - `testDir: ./tests`, `baseURL: http://localhost:3000`, HTML reporter.
  - `webServer`: `cd .. && ./run.sh` to install deps, install Playwright Chromium, and start both backend and frontend.
  - Fully parallel tests; retries in CI; workers=1 in CI.

### Test suites
- `example.spec.ts`: basic page load, add ticker, connection status.
- `app.spec.ts`: UI flows including add/remove, display of price updates, persistence to and restoration from `localStorage`, sorting, duplicate prevention, and invalid inputs.
- `api.spec.ts`: backend health, add/remove ticker success, invalid ticker rejection aligned to `errorMessage` contract (no OPTIONS test because Playwright’s request API doesn’t support it).
- `advanced.spec.ts`: latency (numeric price within 5s), multi-client consistency, metrics presence, resilience (status shows retrying/connected).
- `stress.spec.ts`: N tabs × M symbols ensuring each row appears and every symbol shows a visible price or loading state; waits for debounced persistence.
- `mega_stress.spec.ts`: 10 tabs × 10 symbols per tab; waits for numeric price for all rows with extended timeouts and parallelized assertions.

### How to run
```bash
# From repo root
cd playwright-tests

# CLI
npx playwright test

# UI mode
npx playwright test --ui

# Open the last HTML report
npx playwright show-report
```

Artifacts:
- Reports: `playwright-tests/playwright-report/index.html` and `web/playwright-report/index.html` (if any).
- Traces: `test-results/` and `playwright-tests/test-results/`.

## Concurrency, scalability, and latency
- **Resource reuse**: one browser, one page per symbol shared across all clients.
- **Capacity**: env-configurable caps for open concurrency and max pages; LRU eviction for idle pages; cancellation of queued opens when no longer needed.
- **Time-to-first-price**: screener fast-path with cache, immediate push of last known prices in stream, UI Loading… state until first push.
- **Latency**: MutationObserver ensures push-based, low-latency updates; tests assert visibility and numeric formatting under deadlines.
- **Observability**: `/metrics` exposes pool stats; logs are prefixed in `run.sh` for clarity.

## Problems encountered and fixes
1) Many Chromium windows opening automatically
   - Cause: headed mode plus rapid symbol loads from `localStorage` and tests.
   - Resolution: kept headed mode per requirement; added robust selectors, created isolated test workspace that boots servers via `webServer`; retained symbol persistence but made UI/loading and server initial price push resilient.

2) `npx playwright init` error (unknown command)
   - Cause: version mismatch with installed Playwright.
   - Resolution: used `npx playwright install` and created config/tests manually.

3) Multiple Playwright versions conflict (`test.describe called here`)
   - Cause: different versions across `server` and `web`.
   - Resolution: created isolated `playwright-tests/` with its own config; aligned versions; used `webServer` to start the app.

4) `page.goto` invalid URL
   - Cause: baseURL not effective or server not ready.
   - Resolution: added `webServer` to boot stack; migrated all `page.goto` to `/` and ensured server readiness.

5) UI assertions failing (`toHaveTitle`, Enter key not adding)
   - Cause: app didn’t set title; Enter key wasn’t bound to add.
   - Resolution: removed title assertion; used explicit Add button click.

6) Remove selector strictness and multi-match failures
   - Cause: broad selectors matched multiple rows.
   - Resolution: refined locators to the specific row and role.

7) Strict mode violations using `or()` locators
   - Cause: combining loading and price elements in a single assertion.
   - Resolution: assert on the active element and ensure loading→price transition.

8) Persistence tests flaky with `localStorage`
   - Cause: clearing `localStorage` globally in `beforeEach` broke restore tests; debounce saves not awaited.
   - Resolution: removed global clear; explicitly clear where needed; added waits for debounce and `waitForFunction` to check persistence.

9) Sorting tests reading entire row text
   - Cause: symbol selector captured price and button text.
   - Resolution: select `strong` element containing symbol only.

10) Stress and mega-stress timeouts
    - Cause: heavy page/ticker creation and debounce timings.
    - Resolution: increased timeouts, respected app debounce, waited for row visibility and persistence, parallelized per-page checks.

## Configuration and knobs
- `PLAYWRIGHT_OPEN_CONCURRENCY` (default: 5): number of concurrent page-open operations.
- `PLAYWRIGHT_MAX_PAGES` (default: 30): soft cap on total open pages; evicts idle LRU.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` (default: `http://localhost:8080`): frontend → backend transport base URL.

Example cap sweeps (bash):
```bash
PLAYWRIGHT_OPEN_CONCURRENCY=8 PLAYWRIGHT_MAX_PAGES=50 npx playwright test -g "stress"
PLAYWRIGHT_OPEN_CONCURRENCY=12 PLAYWRIGHT_MAX_PAGES=80 npx playwright test -g "mega stress"
```

## Trade-offs and future work
- Consider multi-process sharding of Playwright across worker processes for extreme loads.
- Optional headless mode for CI while preserving headed for local dev.
- Expand metrics: per-symbol open durations, queue latencies, and error rates.
- Implement backpressure-aware client hints (e.g., pause symbols when tab hidden).
- Add unit tests for pool queue/eviction logic alongside E2E tests.

## Repository hygiene
- Removed redundant Playwright config from `web/` to avoid conflicts; centralized in `playwright-tests/`.
- Tracked Playwright HTML report locations; ensured lockfiles updated.
- `run.sh` kills prior listeners, installs dependencies, installs Playwright Chromium, and starts both services with prefixed logs, cleaning up on exit.

## How to run locally (manual)
```bash
# 1) Start backend and frontend
./run.sh

# 2) Open the app
open http://localhost:3000

# 3) (Optional) Run tests in another terminal
cd playwright-tests && npx playwright test --ui
```
